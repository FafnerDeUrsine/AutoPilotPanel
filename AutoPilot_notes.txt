Auto Pilot Console Project
Jesse Hartman
1/30/23

A physical console for controlling Auto Pilot commands in MSFS.

Needs a PIC microcontroller to handle:

13 Buttons (with MUX)
12 LEDS (with an LED driver)
2 rotery encoder knobs for VS speed and Heading
1 duel rotery encoders for altitude

(Optional)
2 OLED screens for NAV and VNAV information



For the PIC:

USB function:
2 pins needed for D+/D-

5 GPIOs for the buttons. (4 address and a data)

3 GPIO for LEDs

(optional) 1 pin to PWM the LED dim

2 GPIO for encoder MUXs, reusing the address bus from the buttions


Total of 10 GPIOs, 1 PWM (optional), 2 for USB 

Time to search DigiKey.

...

PIC18F4550-I/P looks to be the one, 40-PIN package like the 16f877a so "should" be easy to program.
